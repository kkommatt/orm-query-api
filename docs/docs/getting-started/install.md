## Getting Started

### Installation

Install **orm-query-api** from PyPI with pip:

```bash
pip install orm-query-api
```

This package requires **Python 3.9 or newer** (as specified in its `pyproject.toml`) and works with FastAPI 0.110+, SQLAlchemy 2.0+, Pydantic 2.x, and Lark 1.1+. Its main dependencies (as of version 0.1.0) include FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Lark for parsing grammar. After installation, you can import its components into your FastAPI project.
