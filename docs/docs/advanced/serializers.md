### Custom Serializers and Field Aliasing

You can fully customize how model fields appear in your API by writing your own serializer:

* **Field aliasing**: In `SerializerField("db_field", "alias")`, the second argument is the key used in JSON. For example, `SerializerField("created_at", "creation_time")` means the API will return `"creation_time": "2023-01-01T..."` rather than `"created_at"`.
* **Excluding fields**: Simply omit a field from `fields` to exclude it. (You can also exclude dynamically via the `!field` syntax in the query string, which inverts selection.)
* **Nested relations**: Use `RelationField("relation_name", "alias")` and then query with e.g. `relation_name(id,name)` to retrieve sub-objects.

Example of chaining serializers (using one serializer inside another) might be accomplished by manually invoking `get_serializer()` inside a custom serialize method, but the libraryâ€™s focus is on flat definitions of fields. If you need custom logic (e.g. computed fields), you can simply compute them in your Pydantic models or in FastAPI endpoint logic; **orm-query-api** is primarily about wiring existing model fields.
